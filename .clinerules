Only when using python, I use uv with the following:

uv (fast Python package manager)
* Project setup: `uv init` (creates pyproject.toml, uv.lock).  `uv add <package>` to add dependencies.
* To Run:
    *`uv run <command>` (e.g., `uv run python script.py`)
    * For scripts declaring dependency versions: `uv run script.py`
* Package Management (within a project):
    * Add package: `uv add <package>`
    * Run a command with dependencies (doesn't change project): `uv run --with <package> <command>`
* Updating a Package: `uv lock --upgrade-package <package>` then `uv sync` to install
*  If you have any issues where the project environment does not exist in a directory, or has changed, try `uv sync` to fix this.


Also for python, we use Pathlib instead of os and also logging instead of printing.
The above is only for python projects
